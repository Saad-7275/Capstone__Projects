## Customer Churn Analysis for Telecom Company 'Neo'

This repository contains a detailed customer churn analysis for a telecom company named 'Neo'. The analysis aims to uncover the reasons behind customer attrition and provides insights to help the company retain its customers more effectively.

### Project Overview

The project involves comprehensive data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling to understand the factors leading to customer churn. Here’s a breakdown of the project’s main components:

- **Data Manipulation**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values, extracting specific columns, and segmenting the data based on various criteria like tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.

- **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to explore relationships between various features and churn. This includes bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to illustrate distributions and trends in the data.

- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing several machine learning models to predict customer churn:
  - **Linear Regression**: To predict monthly charges based on tenure.
  - **Logistic Regression**: To predict churn based on monthly charges and other factors.
  - **Decision Tree and Random Forest**: To classify customers on their likelihood to churn based on features like tenure and monthly charges.

### Dataset

The dataset, `customer_churn.csv`, includes various customer attributes such as tenure, monthly charges, internet service type, contract type, payment method, and whether the customer has churned.

### Tools and Libraries Used

- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating the machine learning models.

### Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Usage

Clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts provided. Adjust the data paths and parameters as needed to suit your data analysis and modeling.
