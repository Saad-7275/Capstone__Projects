## COVID-19 Trend Analysis and Prediction

This project is dedicated to analyzing and predicting the trends of the COVID-19 pandemic using data visualization and machine learning techniques. The primary focus is to examine the infection rates, recovery patterns, and the overall impact of the pandemic across different regions and countries.

### Project Overview

- **Data Visualization**: Utilize libraries such as Plotly and Matplotlib to create interactive charts and static graphs that depict the spread and recovery from COVID-19 globally. Visualizations include choropleth maps for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and bar plots to showcase trends over time.

- **Trend Analysis**: Perform an in-depth analysis to understand the progression of the pandemic. This includes grouping data by country and date to observe the trends in confirmed cases, active cases, recoveries, and deaths.

- **Predictive Modeling**: Using Facebook's Prophet library, forecast future trends based on the available data. This component predicts the number of cases over the next week with visualizations to represent the forecasted data.

### Dataset

The dataset `covid_19_clean_complete.csv` contains daily updates on the status of COVID-19 impact including confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases across various countries. The data is preprocessed to align with the needs of visualization and analysis.

### Tools and Libraries Used

- **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Plotly** for interactive choropleth maps.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for generating static plots.
- **Prophet** for time series forecasting.

### Installation

Instructions on setting up the environment and running the project:

```bash
pip install pandas plotly matplotlib seaborn prophet
```

### Usage

Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts provided to generate the analysis and visualizations. Parameters can be adjusted to focus on different aspects or regions as per user interest.
